## What I'm Building
### Nexus
My primary focus for the past few days.

AI-powered automation platform like a no-code alternative to Zapier or IFTTT. It watches Reddit for mentions (like people showing interest in buying from brands such as Apple or Google), uses AI to check sentiment and reason about it, and sends alerts to Discord or Slack.

Built entirely from scratch: Connections to Reddit, AI filters, routing to channels, user management.

Technical implementation: Next.js on Vercel for the frontend, Node workers on AWS Fargate for background tasks, managed Postgres with Prisma, monitoring with OpenTelemetry, and OpenAI GPT-4o for AI parts.

Technical challenges solved:
- Set up secure connections with OAuth and JWT for Reddit access
- Handled dynamic prompts and resource use with protocols like MCP
- Added AI sampling for summaries, user input during runs, JSON validation, real-time updates, and session cleanup
- Expanded with fine-tuning models like Mistral-7B, RAG with Pinecone, prompt testing, and plans for a shared agents marketplace
- Included idempotency, observability, and freemium pricing based on usage

Tech stack: Next.js, Node.js, Postgres, Prisma, OpenTelemetry, OpenAI GPT-4o, Mistral-7B, Pinecone, Vercel, AWS Fargate.

### FireChat | 100+ Weekly Visitors | Ongoing since 03/2025
Quick note on this side project: Finance chat app that looks at your investment portfolio, suggests stocks with links to sources, and shares basic info on things like diversification and risk vs reward. Getting 200+ weekly users.

### ShowQuill
Another idea I'm working on: AI platform that turns podcast or video recordings into show notes, with transcription, key points, timestamps, and easy publishing to places like YouTube or WordPress.
