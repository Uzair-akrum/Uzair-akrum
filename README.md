## What I'm Building
### Make It Heavy - TypeScript Multi-Agent AI Research System
My primary focus for the past few days.

A powerful TypeScript implementation of an advanced multi-agent AI research orchestrator with Lead Agent coordination, specialized search subagents, automatic citations, and comprehensive logging capabilities.

Built entirely from scratch: Single-agent mode for quick queries, enhanced multi-agent mode for complex research, tool system integration, and CLI interface.

Technical implementation: Uses LangChain, OpenRouter for AI models, Redis for memory persistence, and tools like calculator, web search, and file operations.

Technical challenges solved:
- Implemented parallel processing for efficient agent execution
- Added adaptive configuration based on query complexity
- Integrated automatic citations and bibliography generation
- Enabled memory persistence and session management
- Developed extensible tool ecosystem with type safety

Tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js, LangChain, OpenRouter, Redis, DuckDuckGo search, and various npm packages like cheerio, axios, mathjs.

### FireChat | 100+ Weekly Visitors | Ongoing since 03/2025
Quick note on this side project: Finance chat app that looks at your investment portfolio, suggests stocks with links to sources, and shares basic info on things like diversification and risk vs reward. Getting 200+ weekly users.

### ShowQuill
Another idea I'm working on: AI platform that turns podcast or video recordings into show notes, with transcription, key points, timestamps, and easy publishing to places like YouTube or WordPress.
